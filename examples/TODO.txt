multilevel_key.py

    - Keys are not being handled by the correct inner/outer sequence.

multilevel_mix.py

    - Moving out of the first "slide" before it ends and going back to it
      leads to a failing condition with the error:

      01:31:20 E runner <InnerSequenceTimed 's1.d1'> stopped with no parent


multilevel_time.py

nonstop_level1.py

    - Fails like crazy if multi reloads/redos are triggered.
    - Somehow the DelayReturn Loops multiply themselves.
